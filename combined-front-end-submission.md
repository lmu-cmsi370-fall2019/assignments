# Combined Front End Submission Instructions
This document intends to provide a specification for submitting a combined submission of Assignments 1029 and 1114. Assignment 1114 was meant to build on the same repository as Assignment 1029 anyway, so this shouldn’t be too much of a stretch. The goal here is to make it easy—_really_ easy—to switch between having a mock runtime API vs. a real one that makes real network connections.
